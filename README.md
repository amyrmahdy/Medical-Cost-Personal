## **Introduction**<a id="introduction"></a>
The goal of this project is to develop a regression model to predict medical costs based on various factors. By analyzing the provided dataset and using machine learning techniques, we aim to create an accurate model that can estimate medical costs for individuals.

## **Data**<a id="data"></a>
The dataset used in this project is obtained from an external source. It contains information about individuals' medical costs, including features such as age, BMI, number of children, sex, smoker status, and region. The dataset has been loaded into the notebook for analysis and model training.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**<a id="exploratory-data-analysis"></a>
Before proceeding with model training, we performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Some of the key visualizations and observations made during the analysis include:
- Histograms to visualize the distribution of age, BMI, and charges.
- Bar plots to compare the average charges based on regions, sex, smoker status, and number of children.
- Scatter plots to examine the relationship between charges and age, BMI, and number of children.
- Correlation analysis to determine the relationships between numerical features.

## **Data Preprocessing**<a id="data-preprocessing"></a>
To prepare the data for model training, we applied several preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing values using appropriate imputation strategies.
- Scaling numerical features using standard scaling.
- Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.

## **Model Selection and Training**<a id="model-selection-and-training"></a>
In this project, we trained multiple regression models to predict medical costs. The following models were used:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

For each model, we created a pipeline that incorporated the preprocessing steps. The models were trained using the training dataset.

## **Model Evaluation**<a id="model-evaluation"></a>
To evaluate the performance of the trained models, we used the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. We calculated the RMSE for each model by comparing the predicted charges against the actual charges from the test dataset. The models were evaluated on their ability to accurately predict medical costs.

The final random forest regression model achieved an RMSE value of 4158.257085533594. This indicates that the model provides reasonably accurate predictions of medical costs based on the given features.

## **Hyperparameter Tuning**<a id="hyperparameter-tuning"></a>
To improve the performance of the models, we performed hyperparameter tuning using a randomized search approach. For the random forest regression model, we searched for the optimal value of the `max_features` hyperparameter. The best-performing model configuration was selected based on the RMSE metric.

## **Final Model and Predictions**<a id="final-model-and-predictions"></a>
After hyperparameter tuning, the final random forest regression model was selected. This model incorporates the preprocessing steps and the optimal hyperparameter configuration. It provides the most accurate predictions of medical costs based on the given features.

To make predictions on new data, you can use the final trained model and apply the same preprocessing steps as outlined in the notebook.
